Requirements:
1. The LRU Cache should support the following operations
    a. Put(key,value): insert a key, value pair into the cache. If the cache is at capacity, remove the least recently used item, before inserting the new item
    b. Get(key): get the value associated with this key. If the key exists, move the key,value pair to the front of the cache(most recently used) and return its value.
                If the key does not exist, return -1

2. The cache will have a fixed capacity
3. Ensure thread safety for concurrent access to cache by multiple threads
4. Ensure that both put(key,value) and get(key) are efficient in terms of tc O(1)
